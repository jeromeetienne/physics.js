### Introduction

physics.js is a easy to use wrapper on top of box2d. box2d is well known
for its coolness on the screen *AND* for its crapiness in the source.
The api is poorly documented, and the API is not nice to write.

physics.js is my attempts to make box2d easier to use. It has
chained API (ala jQuery) and a plugin system. Examples will be
provided and well documented.
