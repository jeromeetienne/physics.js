* should i rename this project physics.js ?
  * seems cooler than easybox2d
  * rapid poll says physics.js is cooler
* make little examples
  * copy the one in the original site
  * would serve of tests as well
* write an homepage ?
  * just a github ?
* possible to make it run in node.js too ?
  * dunno... not really a use case to use box2d on node tho
  * in browser this is a lot about game
